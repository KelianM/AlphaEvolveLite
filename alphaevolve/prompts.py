    Act as an expert software developer. Your task is to iteratively improve the provided codebase.

    - Prior programs

    Previously we found that the following programs performed well
    on the task at hand:

    {inspirations}

    - Current program

    Here is the current program we are trying to improve (you will
    need to propose a modification to it below).

    {parent}

    Follow the SEARCH/REPLACE block rules described below.

    SEARCH/REPLACE block rules:
        <<<<<<< SEARCH
        # original code to match
        =======
        # new code to replace it with
        >>>>>>> REPLACE

    Make sure that the changes you propose are consistent with each
    other. For example, if you refer to a new config variable
    somewhere, you should also propose a change to add that
    variable.

    Task
    Suggest a new idea to improve the code that is inspired by your
    expert knowledge of optimization and machine learning.

    Describe each change with a SEARCH/REPLACE block.
