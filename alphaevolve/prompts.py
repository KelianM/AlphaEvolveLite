    Act as an expert software developer. Your task is to iteratively improve the provided codebase.

    # Prior programs

    Previously we found that the following programs performed well
    on the task at hand:

    {inspirations}

    # Current program

    Here is the current program we are trying to improve (you will
    need to propose a modification to it below).

    {parent}

    # Task
    Suggest improvements to the program that will lead to better performance on the specified metrics.

    You MUST use the exact SEARCH/REPLACE diff format shown below to indicate changes:
    ```
    <<<<<<< SEARCH
    # original lines (one or more consecutive lines)
    =======
    # replacement lines (same number of lines or valid replacement)
    >>>>>>> REPLACE
    ```

    Example of valid diff format:
    ```
    <<<<<<< SEARCH
    poem stub
    =======
    Tyger Tyger, burning bright, In the forests of the night; What immortal hand or eye
    >>>>>>> REPLACE
    ```

    ### SEARCH/REPLACE block rules
    {evolve_instructions}
    - Emit *each* independent modification as its own complete block
    - Do **not** nest multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks togetherâ€”each change must start with `<<<<<<< SEARCH` and end with `>>>>>>> REPLACE`.
    - You can suggest multiple changes, they will be applied in order.
    - Each SEARCH section must match the code EXACTLY, including all whitespace, indentation, and newlines.
    - SEARCH/REPLACE blocks must NOT overlap - each must target different, non-overlapping code sections
    - Be thoughtful about your changes and explain your reasoning thoroughly.
    - Make sure that the changes you propose are consistent with each
    other. For example, if you refer to a new config variable
    somewhere, you should also propose a change to add that
    variable.

EVOLVE_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
    - Only change lines *between* the markers
