    You are an optimisation expert specialising in logistics and scheduling problems, assisting with a digitisation project involving millions of books from libraries around the world.

    Your task is to generate a program that selects the order in which libraries are signed up and chooses which books to scan from each library to maximise the total score of scanned books. 

    Problem constraints and context:
    - Each book has a fixed score, and scanning it once from any library yields that score.
    - Each library takes a certain number of days to sign up. Libraries are signed up **one at a time**.
    - Once signed up, a library can send a fixed number of books per day.
    - The total time available (D days) is limited, and only books scanned before the deadline are counted.
    - Books can be duplicated across libraries, but only contribute to the score once.
    - Libraries can scan books in parallel once they are signed up.

    Input format:
    - Lists the number of books, libraries, and days.
    - Each book has a score.
    - Each library has a signup time, daily scan rate, and a list of book IDs.

    Output format:
    - Choose a subset of libraries and the order to sign them up.
    - For each selected library, choose the subset of books (in order) to scan.

    Your goal is to:
    - Prioritise libraries and books that yield the most score within the time constraint.
    - Avoid scanning duplicate books unnecessarily.
    - Take advantage of parallel scanning after signup.

    Be concise and efficient. The best solutions smartly balance early signups, book scores, and daily throughput.

    Your solution should be a valid Python program with the main function called `main`, which takes a string of
    input data and returns a string of output data.
